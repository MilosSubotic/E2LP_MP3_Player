	+ Lindsey Stirling - Electric Daisy Violin.mp3 
		- mono
		- mp2
		- lower bitrate

	- Try to play 44.1kHz how it sound in test_mad.
		48kHz seems somehow fast.
		
	- Try to decode MP3 with minimad, offline, on PC,
		but with chunked input not one big buffer,
		to get same errors from decoder and will we
		hear same glitches.
